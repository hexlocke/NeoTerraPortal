  You've learned how to channel your music into magic, using Persuasion as your arcane skill (note that Charisma is not added to Persuasion when used for casting spells). You use the Arcane Spell Failure rule when using medium or heavy armour, or large shields (i.e., if the penalty is 1 then you ignore it, but if it's 2 or 3 then it applies in full). Your spells should generally have a sound-based trapping, and unlike sorcerers and wizards you can even learn healing magic (but not Greater Healing).

Magicians range from powerful wizards to vile cultists. They
draw on raw supernatural energy to fuel their eldritch fires.
This energy often infuses the worlds in which they live, and
is drawn forth with elaborate rituals, words of power, runes,
or perhaps even dark sacrifices.
Wizards are often quite weak early in their careers, but are
forces to be reckoned with as they become powerful sorcerers. Backlash: When a wizard rolls a 1 on his Spellcasting die

Starting Power Points: 10 (but see below)
Starting Powers: 1
Weird Science is the creation of strange and powerful
devices. It differs from regular science in that some element of
the arcane is involved. Maybe it’s just generic “super-science,”
or perhaps it’s divinely (or demonically) inspired. Maybe the
science itself is relatively sound, but it derives power from an
arcane source, such as ghost rock in Deadlands, or some
other magical mineral or essence in a steampunk fantasy
game.
Weird Science is different in that each new power is actually a new “gizmo.” The player must write down exactly what
the device is when he gains the power. An inventor with the
invisibility power, for instance, actually has an invisibility
belt, cloak, etc. Players are encouraged to give their devices
pseudo-scientific names as well (“Dr. Zee’s Chromatic
Disfibulating Device!”).
Weird Science is the skill an inventor uses when activating
most devices, and raises increase the effects of the power
as usual. If a device uses a different skill, such as Driving,
Fighting, or Shooting, the inventor uses that instead. A ray
gun, for example, uses the Shooting skill, while a “vibroknife”
(a knife with the smite power) uses Fighting.
Powers that require an opposed roll, such as puppet, also
use the scientist’s Weird Science skill.
Each device comes with its own Power Points equal to the
inventor’s Power Points. An inventor with the bolt power and
10 Power Points, for example, could make a ray gun that fires
electrical beams. The gun has 10 Power Points it can use
to fire the beams just like a wizard would cast the bolt spell.
Malfunction: Weird science devices are never perfect
technology. They often suffer from spectacular and deadly
malfunctions. If a gadgeteer uses a device and rolls a 1 on
the skill die used to activate the gizmo, it has malfunctioned
in some way and does not work. Draw a card and consult the

powerful supreme sorcerers. They are often physically weak,
however, and rarely have the divine powers or healing abilities
of priestly spellcasters. What they lack in spiritual favor,
however, they more than make up for in utility and eldritch
might.
Wizards tend to learn their craft in formalized institutions
or under the tutelage of experienced masters. Each raise a
Wizard gets on his Spellcasting roll reduces the cost of the
spell by 1 Power Point. The Wizard must have the points
available to cast the spell in the first place before rolling.",,
Woodsman,Professional,Spirit d6;Survival d8;Tracking d8,"Woodsmen are rangers, scouts, and hunters who are more
at home in the wilderness than in urban areas. They are skilled
trackers and scouts, and know how to live off the land for
months at a time. Woodsmen gain +2 to Tracking, Survival,
and Stealth rolls made in the wilderness (not towns, ruins, or
underground).",,
Charismatic,Social,Spirit d8,"Your hero has learned how to work with others, even those
who might be somewhat opposed to him or his efforts. This
adds +2 to his Charisma.",Charisma +2,
Common Bond,Social,Spirit d8,"This Edge signifies a special link between close companions—
such as a typical party. It doesn’t matter whether or not the
characters get along perfectly or not, they’ve just formed a
close and common bond during their epic adventures.
A character with this Edge may freely give his Bennies to any
other Wild Card he can communicate with. This represents
the character giving his verbal or spiritual support to the ally.
The player should say what his character is doing to give
the support. The gesture could be as complex as a rousing
speech, or as simple as a knowing nod.",,
Connections,Social,,TO FILL IN! SPECIAL!,,
Strong Willed,Social,Intimidation d6;Taunt d6,"Characters with strong willpower use their voice, steely
stares, or quick wits to unnerve their opponents. Strong Willed
adds +2 to a character’s Intimidation and Taunt rolls, as well as
his Spirit and Smarts rolls when resisting Test of Wills attacks.",,
Beast Bond,Weird,,"Some individuals can exert incredible will over their animal
companions. These characters may spend their own Bennies
for any animals under their control, including mounts, pet
dogs, familiars, and so on.",,
Beast Master,Weird,Spirit d8,"Animals like your hero, and won’t attack him unless he
attacks them first or they are enraged for some reason. His
“animal magnetism” is so great he’s attracted a loyal animal
of some sort as well. This is typically a dog, wolf, or raptor,
though the GM may allow other companions if it fits the setting.
The beast is an Extra (not a Wild Card). If it should be killed,
the hero finds a replacement in 2d6 days.",,
Danger Sense,Weird,,"Your hero can sense when something bad is about to
happen. Anytime he’s about to be the victim of a surprise
attack, ambush, or other nasty surprise, he gets a Notice roll
at –2 just before the attack or event occurs. If successful,
the character knows something is about to happen and may
take appropriate action against it. This means the hero is on
Hold for the first round of a combat. Should the hero fail his
roll, he still follows the normal Surprise rules, if applicable
(see page 65).",,
Healer,Weird,Spirit d8,"A hero with this Edge adds +2 to all Healing rolls (including
natural healing rolls for his own wounds), whether natural
or magical in nature. Up to five companions traveling with a
Healer add the bonus to their natural healing rolls as well.",,
Liquid Courage,Weird,Vigor d8,"Your hero processes alcohol far differently than most. The
round after consuming a stiff drink (at least 8 ounces of hard
liquor or equivalent), the character’s Vigor increases by one
die type (increasing Toughness as well). The hard drinker can
also ignore one level of wound modifiers (which stacks with
other abilities that do the same).
The effect lasts for one hour after it begins. If the drunkard
seeks inebriation he suffers –2 to Smarts and Agility-based
rolls for as long as he continues to drink and the next 1d6
hours thereafter.",,
Scavenger,Weird,Luck,"Once per session the hero may “suddenly remember” that
he has a much-needed piece of equipment on his person. The
item must be capable of being stored in the hero’s pocket or
bag (assuming he has one), and the Game Master has the
final word on what can be found.",,
Dead Shot,Wild Card,Seasoned;Shooting d10 or Throwing d10,"The character doubles his total damage when making a
successful Shooting or Throwing attack this round.",,
Mighty Blow,Wild Card,Seasoned;Fighting d10,"The character doubles his total damage when making a
successful Fighting attack this round.",,

When dealt a Joker, the character recovers 2d6 Power Points.
He may not exceed his usual limit.",,
